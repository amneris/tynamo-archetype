#
# In order to resolve validation constraint messages Hibernate Validator's default MessageInterpolator recursively
# resolves message parameters against a custom ResourceBundle called ValidationMessages.properties at the root of the
# classpath (this file).
# http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/validator/4.0.1/reference/en/html/validator-usingvalidator.html#section-message-interpolation
#
# The MessageInterpolator builds de PropertyResourceBundle using the InputStream constructor. Constructing a
# PropertyResourceBundle instance from an InputStream requires that the input stream be encoded in ISO-8859-1
# http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/PropertyResourceBundle.html
#
# That's why this file should use the ISO 8859-1 character encoding.
#
# Characters that cannot be directly represented in this encoding can be written using Unicode escapes as defined in
# section 3.3 of "The Java Language Specification" only a single 'u' character is allowed in an escape sequence.
# The native2ascii tool can be used to convert property files to and from other character encodings.
